The author has been exploring the use of LLMs and Agents to build applications, creating 17 tools and demos over a few weeks. Using platforms like Replit, they’ve been able to quickly build functional apps to address immediate problems, feeling highly productive in the process. They deliberately avoid adjusting the code output to assess how capable these tools are at autonomously generating complete applications.

Observing the generated code, they noted it’s often vanilla, with repetitive logic and minimal adherence to traditional software design principles like extensibility, reusability, or testability. Frameworks, which provide structure and consistency in team environments, were largely absent from the process, raising questions about their relevance in a future where Agents dominate software development.

The author speculates that as software development shifts towards agent-driven workflows, traditional architecture patterns may give way to new ones optimized for LLM management. This shift could redefine how we think about frameworks, code quality, and the role of developers. While the future remains uncertain, they find the evolution of this space exciting and look forward to discovering its potential.
