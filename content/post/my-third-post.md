The article explores the role of CSS resets, which address browser-specific style differences to create a consistent starting point for web development. While resets can be useful, their necessity depends on whether these differences impact a project. The author argues that many developers adopt resets uncritically, even when they may not be needed, and highlights that some websites function well without them. To improve frontend development, developers should:
1. Understand the premises behind resets.
2. Evaluate their necessity through reality checks.
3. Avoid complacency by questioning default practices.

The goal is a more thoughtful, selective use of CSS resets tailored to specific project needs.
