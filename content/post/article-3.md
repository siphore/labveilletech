### Summary

This article provides a framework for deciding whether to use new CSS features based on browser support. It considers three key factors:

1. **Fallback Experience**: Assessing how unsupported browsers handle the absence of a feature and whether the user experience is acceptable.
2. **Browser Breakdown**: Evaluating the proportion of users impacted by unsupported browsers.
3. **Potential Harm**: Considering whether lack of support could cause functionality issues or design inconsistencies.

It emphasizes progressive enhancement, using features that gracefully degrade in unsupported environments, and offers strategies like @supports for fallback styles. This approach helps ensure usability across varying browser capabilities.

### My opinion

I loved how this article provides a practical framework for evaluating CSS features based on browser compatibility. Its focus on progressive enhancement and creating accessible experiences fits perfectly with my mission of delivering user-friendly solutions.

This article will serve as a guide when deciding whether to adopt new CSS features in my projects. It will help me weigh the trade-offs of using experimental features versus ensuring compatibility and graceful degradation for all users.
