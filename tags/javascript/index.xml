The author has been exploring the use of LLMs and Agents to build applications, creating 17 tools and demos over a few weeks. Using platforms like Replit, they’ve been able to quickly build functional apps to address immediate problems, feeling highly productive in the process. They deliberately avoid adjusting the code output to assess how capable these tools are at autonomously generating complete applications.
Observing the generated code, they noted it’s often vanilla, with repetitive logic and minimal adherence to traditional software design principles like extensibility, reusability, or testability.</description></item></channel></rss>
